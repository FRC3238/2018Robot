/**
 * DriverConfig class
 * Allows adding profiles for drivers, and allows modification of button ids and drive constants.
 * <p>
 * To add a driver profile, copy the programmer profile and change Programmer to another name.
 * Add the name of the class to the configs array, similar to how the programmer class is listed.
 * You can modify the values in the constructor, or remove them to keep them at their defaults, if they have one.
